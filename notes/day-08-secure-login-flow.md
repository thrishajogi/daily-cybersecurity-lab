## Day 08 – Secure Login Flow

This day demonstrates a basic secure login system using Python and JavaScript.

### Secure practices used:
- Password hashing using SHA-256
- Passwords are never stored in plain text
- Hash comparison during login

### Common insecure practices avoided:
- Storing passwords directly
- Comparing plain-text passwords
- Client-side authentication only

### Key learning:
Authentication security depends on how credentials are stored and verified, not on frontend logic.
