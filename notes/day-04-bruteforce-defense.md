## Day 04 – Brute Force Attack and Defense

A brute-force attack tries many passwords until the correct one is found.

### Why brute-force attacks work:
- Weak passwords
- No attempt limits
- No delay between attempts

### Defense techniques:
- Limit login attempts
- Add time delays
- Lock account temporarily
- Use strong password hashing

This demo shows both attack attempts and a basic defense mechanism.
