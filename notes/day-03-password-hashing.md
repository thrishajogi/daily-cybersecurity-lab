## Day 03 – Password Hashing

Password hashing converts a password into a fixed-length string.

### Why hashing is important:
- Prevents storing plain-text passwords
- Protects users even if database leaks
- One-way process (cannot be reversed)

### Hashing vs Encryption:
- Hashing: one-way (used for passwords)
- Encryption: two-way (used for data storage)

### Common hashing algorithms:
- MD5 (weak, outdated)
- SHA-1 (weak)
- SHA-256 (secure)

Hashing is a core concept in cybersecurity and authentication systems.
